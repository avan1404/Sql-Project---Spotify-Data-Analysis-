# Sql-Project---Spotify-Data-Analysis-

Domain: Music Streaming

Function: Data Analysis

𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄:
In this project, I explored a Spotify dataset sourced from Kaggle to gain insights into streaming trends, track performance, and user engagement. The objective was to analyze the data using SQL to uncover valuable patterns and actionable insights about the music streaming landscape.

𝗧𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀 & 𝗔𝗽𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗮𝗰𝗵:
I leveraged MySQL for writing and executing 15 distinct queries that included techniques like window functions, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), aggregations, and subqueries. These queries addressed various analytical questions, such as identifying top-performing tracks, calculating averages, and ranking tracks.

𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗙𝗶𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 & 𝗦𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀:
Identified tracks with over 1 billion streams and the most-viewed tracks for each artist.
Discovered albums with the highest total views and calculated energy differences within albums.
Ranked tracks by energy values, danceability, and other metrics, highlighting popular trends.
Calculated metrics like cumulative likes, energy-to-liveness ratios, and comments for licensed tracks.

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗜'𝘃𝗲 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗲𝗱:
This project enhanced my SQL proficiency, allowing me to tackle real-world data scenarios effectively. I gained hands-on experience in analyzing datasets, deriving meaningful insights, and answering complex queries. These skills are essential for data-driven decision-making in dynamic industries like music streaming.
